# 1.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF ANALYSIS:
* While on vacation in Hawaii last year, I discover the new passion for surfing Iâ€™ve been trying to come up with the plan that will not me not return to the Hawaii but live there forever.
* I finally come up with the idea to open a surfing shake shop, serving surf boards and ice-creams to local and tourists.  
* I have some shavings I willing to invest but need some invest for backing to get up this to ground.
* After putting together, the strong business plan, reach out the the business investor W. Avy, who was famous for his surfing. My meeting with him was very fruitful but the question arises about the weather as in his earlier ventures because of the lack of weather analysis, the business was in loss and ultimately, they need to shut it down.
* W.Avy wants me to run the weather data analysis with the data set has.
* After running the initial analysis, he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

# 2. RESULT OF ANALYSIS:
##  a)  The Result of the analysis comes out like below:
#### i) THE TEMPERATURE REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE:

#### ii) THE TEMPERATURE REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER:

## b) The key difference between in weather between June and December are:
*  Min temperature:

      For June---- 64 Degrees

      For December-------56 Degrees
  
* Standard Deviation:

     For June----------3.257

     For December-----3.746
     
* Percentile Values:
	    
      For June------------ 25%      73
	                         50%      75
	                         75%      77
	
     
     For December-------------25%      69
	                            
                              50%      71
	                           
                             75%      74
                             
                             
# 3. SUMMARY: 
* The result suggests that the temp for June is more suitable than that of December as the Min temperature of June is better than December.
* As the St.Dev for June is less than that of the December, mean temperature for the June looks better than that of December.
* The percentile values for the June and December also suggest the same thing.
* However the number of data collected for month of December is less than that of June by about 11% , that may be the reason for the difference in temp. 
* Here only two months data was analyzed, but need to analyze the data for the entire year for the feasibility of the project. 
* Besides the temperatures other parameters like wind, precipitation etc. are also need to be analyzed for the successful outcomes.
